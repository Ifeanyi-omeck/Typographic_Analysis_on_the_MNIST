# Typographic_Analysis_on_the_MNIST
Conducting typographic analysis on the MNIST to understand what enhancement can be used to improve legibility

This GitHub repository contains a study on the impact of typographic enhancements on legibility, particularly for Intelligent Character Recognition (ICR) systems. The project uses the MNIST dataset, dimensionality reduction techniques, clustering, and typographic enhancement to improve the legibility and recognition of handwritten digits.

# Overview
The primary objectives of this study are to:

Assess the impact of typographic enhancements on legibility
Explore the potential of machine learning models for deciphering and separating digitized text
Understand and rank the effectiveness of typographic enhancements
Methodology
The study uses the following steps for analysis:

Dimensionality Reduction (using Principal Component Analysis)
Scree plot for the selection of eigenvectors based on explained variance
Unsupervised models (K-means Clustering) to identify misclassified values
Typographic enhancement of the dataset
Ranking the effectiveness of the typographic enhancement.
